Implement a C++ code that solves the following question:

Alice and Bob are playing a game. Each player rolls a regular six faced dice 3 times.
The score of a player is the maximum number that can be formed using the rolls.
The player with the highest score wins, and the game ends in a tie if both players have the same score.

Find the winner of the game or determine whether it is a tie.

Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case contains six space-separated integers A1, A2, A3, B1, B2 and B3 — the values Alice gets in her 3 dice rolls, followed by the values which Bob gets in his 3 dice rolls.

Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line Alice if Alice wins, Bob if Bob wins and Tie in case of a tie.

Note that you may print each character in uppercase or lowercase. For example, the strings tie, TIE, Tie, and tIe are considered identical.

Constraints
1≤T≤10^4
1≤A1,A2,A3,B1,B2,B3≤6
Sample 1:
Input
3
3 2 5 6 1 1
4 4 5 5 4 4
6 6 6 6 6 1
Output
Bob
Tie
Alice

Explanation:
Test Case 1: Alice's score is 532 which is less than Bob's score 611.
Test Case 2: Alice's score is 544 which is same as Bob's score 544.
Test Case 3: Alice's score is 666 which is greater than as Bob's score 661.
