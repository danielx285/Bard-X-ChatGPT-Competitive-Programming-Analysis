Implement a C++ code that solves the following question:

Problem
The apocalypse has arrived, and Alice and her
4 other family members (a total of 
5 people) are now stuck in a shopping mall from where they have nowhere to run.
Fortunately, the place where they are stuck has frozen buns which they can eat and survive.

There are N buns in the mall, and each member of the family needs to eat X buns everyday to survive.
After the food supply runs out, the family can survive for a further D days.

How many days can Alice and family survive under these conditions?

Note: If there aren't enough buns to feed the whole family, nobody will eat anything. The samples below showcase an example of this.

Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
The first and only line of each test case contains three space-separated integers N,X, and D — the total number of frozen buns, the number of buns every member needs everyday, and the number of days everyone can survive after food gets exhausted, respectively.

Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line the total number of days Alice and family can survive.

1≤T≤10^5

1≤X≤10
0≤D<20

2
50 2 10
120 5 15
Output
15
19

Explanation:
Test case 1: There are 50 buns, and each person requires 2 per day; so the overall requirement is 10 buns per day.
This allows the bun stock to last for 5 days, after which the family can survive for an additional 10 days for a total of 15.

Test case 2: There are 120 buns, and each person requires 5 per day; so the overall requirement is 25 buns per day.
After 4 days, there will be 125−4⋅25=20 buns remaining.
This is not enough to feed everyone, so nobody will eat and the family will only survive for D=15 days more; for a total of 4+15=19 days.
