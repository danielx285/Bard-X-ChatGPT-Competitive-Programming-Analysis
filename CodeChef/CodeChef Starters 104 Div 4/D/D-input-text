Implement a C++ code that solves the following question:

Alice and Bob are playing a game. They have two positive integers X and Y.

In one operation:
First Alice would replace exactly one of the numbers with the gcd of current numbers. In words, she would select either X or Y and replace it with gcd(X,Y).
Then Bob would replace exactly one of the numbers with the lcm of current numbers.

Find the minimum sum of numbers they can achieve after K number of operations.

Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of three space-separated integers X,Y, and K — denoting the initial numbers and the number of operations.

Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line, the minimum sum of numbers they can achieve after K operations.

Constraints
1≤T≤10 
1≤X,Y,K≤10^5

Sample 1:
Input
3
4 2 1
1 5 2
4 4 10
Output
4
2
8

Explanation:
Test case 1: Alice will replace 4 by the gcd, which is 2. The numbers become 2 and 2. Then, Bob will replace 2 with the lcm, which is 2. Thus, the final sum is 4.

Test case 3: Since both numbers are equal, both gcd and lcm would be 4. Thus, the sum of two numbers after all operations remains same, i.e., 8.
