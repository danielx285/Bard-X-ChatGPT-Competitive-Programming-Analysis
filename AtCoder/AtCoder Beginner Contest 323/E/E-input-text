Implement a C++ code that solves the following question:

Time Limit: 2 sec / Memory Limit: 1024 MB

Score : 450 points

Problem Statement
Takahashi has a playlist with N songs. Song i (1≤i≤N) lasts Ti seconds.Takahashi has started random play of the playlist at time 0.

Random play repeats the following: choose one song from the N songs with equal probability and play that song to the end. Here, songs are played continuously: once a song ends, the next chosen song starts immediately. The same song can be chosen consecutively.

Find the probability that song 1 is being played (X+0.5) seconds after time 0, modulo 998244353.

How to print a probability modulo 998244353:
It can be proved that the probability to be found in this problem is always a rational number. Also, the constraints of this problem guarantee that when the probability to be found is expressed as an irreducible fraction y/x, x is not divisible by 998244353.
Then, there is a unique integer z between 
0 and 998244352, inclusive, such that xz≡y(mod998244353). Report this z.

Constraints
2≤N≤10^3
0≤X≤10^4
1≤Ti≤10^4
All input values are integers.

Input
The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N X
T1 T2 … TN
​
Output
Print the probability, modulo 998244353, that the first song in the playlist is being played (X+0.5) seconds after time 0.

Sample Input 1
3 6
3 5 6

Sample Output 1
369720131

Note 1
Song1 will be playing 6.5 seconds after time 
0 if songs are played in one of the following orders.
Song1 → Song1 → Song1
Song2 → Song1
Song3 → Song1
The probability that one of these occurs is 7/27.
We have 369720131×27≡7(mod998244353), so you should print 369720131.


Sample Input 2
5 0
1 2 1 2 1

Sample Output 2
598946612

Note 2
0.5 seconds after time 0, the first song to be played is still playing, so the sought probability is 1/5.
Note that different songs may have the same length.


Sample Input 3
5 10000
1 2 3 4 5

Sample Output 3
586965467
