Implement a C++ code that solves the following question:

Time Limit: 2 sec / Memory Limit: 1024 MB

Score : 
250 points

Problem Statement
The programming contest World Tour Finals is underway, where N players are participating, and half of the competition time has passed. There are M problems in this contest, and the score Ai of problem i is a multiple of 100 between 500 and 2500, inclusive.

For each i=1,…,N, you are given a string Si that indicates which problems player i has already solved. Si is a string of length M consisting of o and x, where the j-th character of Si is o if player i has already solved problem j, and x if they have not yet solved it. Here, none of the players have solved all the problems yet.

The total score of player i is calculated as the sum of the scores of the problems they have solved, plus a bonus score of i points.
For each i=1,…,N, answer the following question.
At least how many of the problems that player i has not yet solved must player i solve to exceed all other players' current total scores?

Note that under the conditions in this statement and the constraints, it can be proved that player i can exceed all other players' current total scores by solving all the problems, so the answer is always defined.

Constraints
2≤N≤100
1≤M≤100
500≤Ai≤2500
Ai is a multiple of 100.
Si is a string of length M consisting of o and x.
Si contains at least one x.
All numeric values in the input are integers.

Note 1
The players' total scores at the halfway point of the competition time are 2001 points for player 1, 1502 points for player 
2, and 1703 points for player 3.
Player 1 is already ahead of all other players' total scores without solving any more problems.
Player 2 can, for example, solve problem 
4 to have a total score of 3502 points, which would exceed all other players' total scores.
Player 3 can also, for example, solve problem 
4 to have a total score of 3703 points, which would exceed all other players' total scores.
