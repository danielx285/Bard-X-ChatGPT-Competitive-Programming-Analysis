Implement a C++ code that solves the following question:

Time Limit: 2 sec / Memory Limit: 1024 MB

Score : 
100 points

Problem Statement
You are given N integers A1,A2,…,AN.

If their values are all equal, print Yes; otherwise, print No.

Constraints
2≤N≤100
1≤Ai≤100 (1≤i≤N)
All input values are integers.
Input
The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

N
A1 A2 … AN
 
Output
Print a single line containing Yes if the values of the given A1​,A2,…,AN are all equal, and No otherwise.

Sample Input 1
3
3 2 4

Sample Output 1
No

We have 
A1 !=A2, so you should print No.


Sample Input 2
4
3 3 3 3

Sample Output 2
Yes
We have A1=A2=A3=A4, so you should print Yes.


Sample Input 3
10
73 8 55 26 97 48 37 47 35 55

Sample Output 3
No
