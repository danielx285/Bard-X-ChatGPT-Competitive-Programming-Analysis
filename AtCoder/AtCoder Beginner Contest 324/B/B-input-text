Implement a C++ code that solves the following question:

Time Limit: 2 sec / Memory Limit: 1024 MB

Score : 200 points

Problem Statement
You are given a positive integer N. If there are integers x and y such that N=(2^x)(3^y), print Yes; otherwise, print No.

Constraints
1≤N≤10^18
N is an integer.
Input
The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
Output
Print a single line containing Yes if there are integers 
x and y that satisfy the condition, and No otherwise.

Sample Input 1
324

Sample Output 1
Yes

Note 1
For x=2,y=4, we have (2^x)(3^y)=(2^2)(3^4)=4×81=324, so the condition is satisfied. Thus, you should print Yes.


Sample Input 2
5
Sample Output 2
No

Note 2
There are no integers x and y such that (2^x)(3^y) =5. Thus, you should print No.


Sample Input 3
32

Sample Output 3
Yes

Note 3
For x=5,y=0, we have (2^x)(3^y)=32×1=32, so you should print Yes.


Sample Input 4
37748736

Sample Output 4
Yes
