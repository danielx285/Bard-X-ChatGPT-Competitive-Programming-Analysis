Implement a C++ code that solves the following question:

Time Limit: 2 sec / Memory Limit: 1024 MB

Score : 200 points

Problem Statement
You are given an integer B.
If there exists a positive integer A such that A^A =B, print its value; otherwise, output -1.

Constraints
1≤B≤10^18
B is an integer.

Input
The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
B

Output
If there exists a positive integer A such that A^A=B, print its value; otherwise, print -1.
If there are multiple positive integers A such that A^A=B, any of them will be accepted.

Sample Input 1
27
Sample Output 1
3
note: 3^3=27, so print 3.

Sample Input 2
100
Sample Output 2
-1
note: There is no A such that A^A=B.

Sample Input 3
10000000000
Sample Output 3
10
