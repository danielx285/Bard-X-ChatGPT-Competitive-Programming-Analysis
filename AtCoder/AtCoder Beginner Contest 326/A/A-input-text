Implement a C++ code that solves the following question:

Time Limit: 2 sec / Memory Limit: 1024 MB

Score : 100 points

Problem Statement
Takahashi is in a building with 
100 floors.

He uses the stairs for moving up two floors or less or moving down three floors or less, and uses the elevator otherwise.

Does he use the stairs to move from floor X to floor Y?

Constraints
1≤X,Y≤100
X!=Y
All input values are integers.

Input
The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
X Y

Output
If Takahashi uses the stairs for the move, print Yes; if he uses the elevator, print No.

Sample Input 1
1 4

Sample Output 1
No

Note 1
The move from floor 1 to floor 4 involves going up three floors, so Takahashi uses the elevator.


Sample Input 2
99 96

Sample Output 2
Yes

Note 2
The move from floor 99 to floor 96 involves going down three floors, so Takahashi uses the stairs.


Sample Input 3
100 1

Sample Output 3
No
