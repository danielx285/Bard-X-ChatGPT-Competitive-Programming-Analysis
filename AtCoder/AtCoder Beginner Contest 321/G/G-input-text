Problem Statement
You are creating an electrical circuit using N parts numbered 1 to N and M cables. These parts have a total of M red terminals and M blue terminals, with the i-th red terminal attached to part Ri and the i-th blue terminal attached to part Bi. Each cable connects one red terminal and one blue terminal. In particular, it is allowed to connect two terminals attached to the same part. You cannot connect two or more cables to a terminal. Therefore, there are M! ways in total to connect the M cables (the cables are not distinguished from each other).
Let s be the number of connected components when seeing this circuit as a graph with parts as vertices and cables as edges. Find the expected value, modulo 998244353, of s when randomly choosing the way to connect the M cables out of the M! ways.

What does it mean to find an expected value modulo 998244353?
-It can be proved that the sought expected value is always a rational number. Also, under the constraints of this problem, it can be proved that when this value is expressed as P/Q using two coprime integers P and Q, there is exactly one integer R that satisfies R×Q≡P(mod998244353) and 0≤R<998244353. Find this R.

'Let (i,j) denote the action of connecting the i-th red terminal and the j-th blue terminal with a cable.
For (1,1),(2,2): There will be two connected components, {1,3} and {2}, so s=2.
For (1,2),(2,1): The whole graph constitutes one connected component, so s=1.
Thus, the expected value of s is 3/2 ≡499122178(mod998244353).'
