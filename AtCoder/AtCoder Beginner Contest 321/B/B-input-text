Implement a C++ code that solves the following question:
Time Limit: 2 sec / Memory Limit: 1024 MB

Score : 
200 points

Problem Statement
There is an exam structured as follows.

The exam consists of N rounds called round 1 to N.
In each round, you are given an integer score between 0 and 100, inclusive.
Your final grade is the sum of the N−2 of the scores earned in the rounds excluding the highest and lowest.
Formally, let S=(S1 ,S2​ ,…,SN ) be the sequence of the scores earned in the rounds sorted in ascending order, then the final grade is S2 + S3 +⋯+SN−1.
Now, N−1 rounds of the exam have ended, and your score in round i was Ai.
Print the minimum score you must earn in round N for a final grade of X or higher.
If your final grade will never be X or higher no matter what score you earn in round N, print -1 instead.
Note that your score in round N can only be an integer between 0 and 100.
