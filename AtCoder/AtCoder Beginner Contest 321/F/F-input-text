Problem Statement
We have a box, which is initially empty.
Let us perform a total of Q operations of the following two types in the order they are given in the input.
+ x
Type 1: Put into the box a ball with the integer x written on it.
- x
Type 2: Remove from the box a ball with the integer x written on it.
It is guaranteed that the box contains a ball with the integer x written on it before the operation.

For the box after each operation, solve the following problem.

Find the number, modulo 998244353, to pick up some number of balls from the box so that the integers written on them sum to K.
All balls in the box are distinguishable.

Constraints
All input values are integers.
1≤Q≤5000
1≤K≤5000
For each type-1 operation, 1≤x≤5000.
All the operations satisfy the condition in the problem statement.
Input
The input is given from Standard Input in the following format, where Queryi represents the i-th operation:
Q K
Query1
​Query2
​⋮
QueryQ

Output
Print Q lines.
The i-th line should contain the answer when the first i operations have been done.

'This input contains 15 operations.'
'After the last operation, the box contains the balls (5,10,1,3,1,7,4).'
'There are five ways to pick up balls for a sum of 10:
5+1+3+1 (the 1-st, 3-rd, 4-th, 5-th balls)
5+1+4 (the 1-st, 3-rd, 7-th balls)
5+1+4 (the 1-st, 5-th, 7-th balls)
10 (the 2-nd ball)
3+7 (the 4-th, 6-th balls)'
