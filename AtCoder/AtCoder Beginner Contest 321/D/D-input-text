Problem Statement
AtCoder cafeteria offers N main dishes and M side dishes. The price of the i-th main dish is Ai, and that of the j-th side dish is Bj.The cafeteria is considering introducing a new set meal menu. A set meal consists of one main dish and one side dish. Let s be the sum of the prices of the main dish and the side dish, then the price of the set meal is min(s,P). Here, P is a constant given in the input.

There are 
NM ways to choose a main dish and a side dish for a set meal. Find the total price of all these set meals.

Constraints
1≤N,M≤2×10^5
1≤Ai,Bj ≤10^8
1≤P≤2×10^8 
All input values are integers.

Input
The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N M P
A1 A2 … AN
B1 B2 … BM

Output
Print the answer as an integer. Under the constraints of this problem, it can be proved that the answer fits into a 64-bit signed integer.

'If you choose the first main dish and the first side dish, the price of the set meal is min(3+6,7)=7.'
'If you choose the first main dish and the second side dish, the price of the set meal is min(3+1,7)=4.'
'If you choose the second main dish and the first side dish, the price of the set meal is min(5+6,7)=7.'
'If you choose the second main dish and the second side dish, the price of the set meal is min(5+1,7)=6.'
'Thus, the answer is 7+4+7+6=24.'
