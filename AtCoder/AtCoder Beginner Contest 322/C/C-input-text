Problem Statement
The AtCoder Kingdom holds a festival for N days. On M of these days, namely on the A1-th, A2-th, …, AM-th days, fireworks will be launched. It is guaranteed that fireworks will be launched on the last day of the festival. (In other words, AM =N is guaranteed.)

For each i=1,2,…,N, solve the following problem.
How many days later from the i-th day will fireworks be launched for the first time on or after the i-th day? If fireworks are launched on the i-th day, it is considered to be 0 days later.

Constraints
1≤M≤N≤2×10^5
1≤A1<A2<⋯<AM=N
All input values are integers.

Input
The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N M
A1 A2 … AM​

Output
Print N lines.
The i-th line (1≤i≤N) should contain an integer representing the number of days from the i-th day until fireworks are launched for the first time on or after the i-th day.

Note 1:
The kingdom holds a festival for 3 days, and fireworks are launched on the 2-nd and 3-rd days.
From the 1-st day, the first time fireworks are launched is the 2-nd day of the festival, which is 1 day later.
From the 2-nd day, the first time fireworks are launched is the 2-nd day of the festival, which is 0 days later.
From the 3-rd day, the first time fireworks are launched is the 3-rd day of the festival, which is 0 days later.
