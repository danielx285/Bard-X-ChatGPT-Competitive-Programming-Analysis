Implement a C++ code that solves the following question:

time limit per test2 seconds
memory limit per test256 megabytes
inputstandard input
outputstandard output

You are given an array of integers a1,a2,…,an.

A pair of integers (i,j), such that 1≤i<j≤n, is called good, if there does not exist an integer k (1≤k≤n) such that ai is divisible by ak and aj is divisible by ak at the same time.

Please, find the number of good pairs.

Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1≤t≤2⋅10^4). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1≤n≤10^6).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤n).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.

Output
For each test case, output the number of good pairs.

Note
In the first test case, there are no good pairs.

In the second test case, here are all the good pairs: (1,2), (2,3), and (2,4).
