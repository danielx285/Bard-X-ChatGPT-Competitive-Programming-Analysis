Implement a C++ code that solves the following question:

time limit per test 1 second
memory limit per test 256 megabytes
inputstandard input
outputstandard output

A positive integer is called k-beautiful, if the digit sum of the decimal representation of this number is divisible by k†. For example, 9272 is 5-beautiful, since the digit sum of 9272 is 9+2+7+2=20.

You are given two integers x and k. Please find the smallest integer y≥x which is k-beautiful.
† An integer n is divisible by k if there exists an integer m such that n=k⋅m.

Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1≤t≤10^4). The description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers x and k (1≤x≤10^9, 1≤k≤10).

Output
For each test case, output the smallest integer y≥x which is k-beautiful.

Example
input
6
1 5
10 8
37 9
777 3
1235 10
1 10

output
5
17
45
777
1243
19

Note
In the first test case, numbers from 1 to 4 consist of a single digit, thus the digit sum is equal to the number itself. None of the integers from 1 to 4 are divisible by 5.

In the fourth test case, the digit sum of 777 is 7+7+7=21 which is already divisible by 3
