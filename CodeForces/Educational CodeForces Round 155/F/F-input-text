time limit per test 7 seconds
memory limit per test 512 megabytes
inputstandard input
outputstandard output
There are n heroes in a videogame. Each hero has some health value h and initial armor value a. Let the current value of armor be acur, initially equal to a.

When x points of damage are inflicted on a hero, the following happens: if x<acur, then x gets subtracted from acur; otherwise, 1 gets subtracted from h and acur gets assigned back to a.

In the start of the game, you choose the value x (an integer strictly greater than 0, arbitrarily large). Then you keep attacking all heroes in rounds: in one round, you inflict x points of damage to all alive heroes. A hero dies when his health becomes 0. The game ends when all heroes are dead.

The last hero to die earns the number of points, equal to the number of rounds he was the only hero alive. The other heroes get 0 points. In particular, if the last round ends with multiple heroes dying, then every hero gets 0 points.

The game is played for every possible x (from 1 to infinity). The points are reset between the games. What's the maximum number of points each hero has had?

Input
The first line contains a single integer t (1≤t≤10) — the number of testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (1≤n≤2⋅10^5) — the number of heroes.

The second line contains n integers h1,h2,…,hn (1≤hi≤2⋅10^5) — the health value of each hero.

The third line contains n integers a1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤2⋅10^5) — the initial armor value of each hero.

Output
For each testcase, print n integers — the maximum number of points each hero has had over the games played for every possible x.

Note
In the first testcase, the game for x=1 is played as follows:

before all rounds: the heroes have h=[3,1,2], acur=[3,11,5];
round 1: 1 damage is inflicted on every hero: h remains [3,1,2], acur becomes [2,10,4];
round 2: h=[3,1,2], acur=[1,9,3];
round 3: the first hero runs out of armor, so he loses a health point: h=[2,1,2], acur=[3,8,2];
...
round 9: the first hero dies, since his health reaches 0: h=[0,1,1], acur=[0,2,1];
round 10: the third hero dies: h=[0,1,0], acur=[0,1,0];
round 11: the second hero dies: h=[0,0,0], acur=[0,0,0].
The second hero was the last hero to die, and he was the only hero alive during one round. Thus, he gets 1 point for that game.

The game for x=4 is played as follows:

round 1: h=[2,1,2], acur=[3,7,1];
round 2: h=[1,1,1], acur=[3,3,5];
round 3: h=[0,0,1], acur=[0,0,1];
round 4: h=[0,0,0], acur=[0,0,0];
The third hero was the last hero to die, and he was the only hero alive during one round.
